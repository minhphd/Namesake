Namesake is an open-source tool for assessing confusing naming combinations in Python programs.
Namesake flags confusing identifier naming combinations that are similar in:
* orthography (word form)
* phonology (pronunciation)
* or semantics (meaning).

## üí° What is Lexical Similarity in Code?

Orthographic similarity focuses on the the similarity in word form on the level of letters. Not to be confused by editing distance or Levenshtein's distance, where one letter is replaced by another, orthographic similarity focuses on the similarities between letters shapes.  A good example is the confusion between `O' and `C' as individual letters or within words and sentences. Here's a common exmple in code:

Phonological similarity describes two words that share a similar or identical pronunciation, also known as homophones:
